- 👋 Hi, I’m @jesusgetial94
Senior Software Engineer / Tech Lead with 8+ years of experience building, modernizing, and operating full-stack web applications. I specialize in .NET (APIs, microservices) and Angular (SPA), delivering scalable solutions with strong engineering standards, clean architecture, and a pragmatic focus on business outcomes.
On the backend, I design and implement REST/SOAP services, data-driven APIs, and microservices using C# / .NET Core, working with SQL and NoSQL databases (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Oracle). I apply clean design principles (Clean Architecture / layered approaches), focus on maintainability, and support high-quality delivery through solid testing practices (unit/integration/E2E).
On the frontend, I build Angular SPAs using TypeScript, emphasizing performance, modularity, and a smooth user experience (HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Bootstrap, Tailwind). I’m also comfortable owning the build-to-production lifecycle, including CI/CD with Azure DevOps (YAML), Docker, Kubernetes (AKS), and Terraform (IaC) across Azure (and AWS when needed).
I contribute strongly to operational excellence: improving reliability through observability (Dynatrace, Grafana), leading complex production incidents, and driving architectural enhancements that reduce risk and operational overhead. I enjoy mentoring engineers, strengthening team practices, and collaborating with stakeholders to translate requirements into high-quality deliveries.
